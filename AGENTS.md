# Knowledge Forge Agent Guide

## Project
Knowledge Forge is a separate repository in the broader FlowCommander project.

Its job is to turn *promoted candidate source packs* — manuals, bulletins,
SOPs, checklists, inspection and service forms, drawings, and other
field-service source material — into reviewable, human-readable knowledge
artifacts that can be proposed back to FlowCommander through a pull request
workflow. Knowledge Forge is the refinement engine; FlowCommander is the
operational intake surface and the downstream consumer of approved knowledge.

Core responsibilities:
- intake and manifesting of candidate source packs (curated during bootstrap, promoted from FlowCommander in steady state)
- pre-bucketing and parsing preparation across the full source taxonomy (not manuals only)
- structured extraction and wiki compilation
- contradiction and supersession analysis
- guardrails that reject or downgrade low-signal operational material so it does not become published knowledge, with rejections visible back to the FlowCommander promoter
- provenance-preserving staging for publish, including back-references to originating FlowCommander artifact IDs where applicable
- PR-based publication into FlowCommander `repo-wiki/knowledge/`

Out of scope:
- reading FlowCommander's operational tables directly
- publishing customer/site/station-scoped knowledge until the publish contract is explicitly extended for scoped targets

Primary priorities:
- trustworthy generated artifacts
- provenance and reviewability
- safe repo-to-repo workflow boundaries
- practical local agent execution
- minimal operational friction for future Codex work

## Working Rules
- Keep Knowledge Forge separate from FlowCommander. Do not collapse the two repos
  into one working tree or one architecture.
- Respect the current repo state. This repository is still in bootstrap mode; do
  not invent finished pipeline code when only planning or scaffolding exists.
- Favor small, mergeable changes and explicit docs over hidden conventions.
- Do not widen scope into publish automation unless the repo already contains the
  necessary implementation path.
- Generated FlowCommander-facing output must preserve provenance, reviewability,
  and rerun safety.
- Do not directly edit FlowCommander `repo-wiki` as an ad hoc side effect of
  normal Knowledge Forge work. Publication happens through a controlled PR flow.
- During normal Knowledge Forge issue execution, do not make FlowCommander
  `repo-wiki` changes unless explicitly instructed.

## FlowCommander Integration Boundary
- FlowCommander is the downstream product and integration repo.
- Knowledge Forge is the upstream artifact-generation repo.
- The intended publish target is FlowCommander `repo-wiki/knowledge/`.
- Local inspection of `/Users/taylor/development/FlowCommander` is encouraged
  when present so agents can validate target structure and downstream
  expectations.
- Local FlowCommander access is for inspection, comparison, and publish
  preparation. It is not a license to silently write into that repo.
- Any eventual publish step should stage reviewable output in Knowledge Forge
  first, then open a PR against `TNwkrk/FlowCommander`.

## Local Working Conventions
- Keep repo-local Codex defaults in `.codex/`.
- Put durable repo behavior in checked-in docs such as this file and
  `docs/agent-workflow.md`.
- Use `.env.example` and committed docs for shared setup guidance. Do not commit
  secrets, tokens, or machine-private settings.
- Treat `data/` as a local working area for generated artifacts. Commit only
  intentional scaffolding files such as `README.md` and `.gitkeep`.

## Canonical References
- `README.md` explains the repo's purpose, scope, and FlowCommander boundary.
- `AGENTS.md` is the top-level operating rules document for agents.
- `WORKFLOW.md` is the Symphony/Codex issue-execution contract for isolated,
  one-issue-at-a-time autonomous runs.
- `docs/codex-issue-runbook.md` is the standard issue-worker runbook.
- `docs/roadmap.md` is the source of truth for phased issue sequencing.
- `docs/publish-contract.md` defines the downstream publish contract.
- `docs/repo-structure.md` defines the intended artifact layout.
- `docs/evals.md` defines the current lightweight fixtures and golden-file
  skeleton.

## Start Here
- Before meaningful work, read `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/roadmap.md` first.
- For Symphony-style autonomous issue execution, also read `WORKFLOW.md` before
  starting the issue loop.
- For publish-boundary or downstream handoff work, also read `docs/publish-contract.md` and `docs/agent-workflow.md` before editing.
- Keep scope honest to the current roadmap phase. Do not describe unfinished pipeline stages as if they already exist.
- Use local FlowCommander inspection for comparison and publish preparation, not as permission for direct downstream mutation.

## Task Routing
- New feature or unclear scope: tighten the problem and phase boundary first, then make a short implementation plan.
- Bug or regression: investigate the failure against the current repo phase before editing.
- Roadmap or issue execution: confirm the phase, acceptance signal, and intended artifact shape before coding.
- Documentation or contract work: prefer updating the existing docs that already own the boundary or structure rule.
- Cross-repo publish work: stage reviewable artifacts in Knowledge Forge first, then hand off through an explicit PR into FlowCommander `repo-wiki/knowledge/`.

## Phase Boundaries
- **Bootstrap**: repo setup, docs, package scaffolding, local tooling, and basic
  validation are in scope. Full parser, extraction, or publish implementations
  are not.
- **Pipeline / parsing**: intake, bucketing, OCR, parse artifact shape, and
  parser validation are in scope. Topic-page generation, publish automation, and
  downstream integration are not.
- **Inference / extraction**: OpenAI client behavior, schema validation,
  provenance, extraction repair, and extraction evals are in scope. FlowCommander
  product behavior and final publish workflows are not.
- **Publish / integration**: staging, publish-contract validation, manifesting,
  and PR-oriented handoff into FlowCommander are in scope. Casual direct writes
  into FlowCommander and unrelated product changes are not.

## Safe Edit Zones
- Usually safe to modify: `docs/`, `.codex/`, `tests/`, and small scaffolding in
  `src/knowledge_forge/` that matches the current roadmap phase.
- Edit with care: `pyproject.toml`, `.env.example`, `data/README.md`, and any
  schema or artifact-shape docs that define downstream expectations.
- Do not change unless the issue requires it: FlowCommander local clone content,
  publish-boundary assumptions in `docs/publish-contract.md`, and repo-wide
  structure or naming conventions already referenced by other docs.

## Issue Acceptance Signals
- Every issue should have a concrete acceptance signal before work starts.
- Preferred signals are real commands, schema validation, expected artifact
  shapes, or explicit docs-consistency checks.
- If the repo does not yet have executable checks for an issue, document the
  honest validation that was performed instead of implying stronger coverage.
- Treat vague completion like "looks good" as insufficient for closing an issue
  or opening a PR.

## Documentation Maintenance
- When durable behavior, workflow boundaries, artifact layout, or publish rules
  change, update the relevant docs in `docs/`.
- Prefer updating an existing doc over creating a duplicate page.
- Keep the architecture, repo structure, publish contract, and agent workflow
  docs aligned with each other.
- If no doc update is needed for a change, say so explicitly in the final report.

## Git Workflow
- Always create a new branch for implementation work.
- Use clear branch names scoped to the task.
- Commit logically grouped changes.
- Open a PR when the work is ready for review.
- For pull requests in `TNwkrk/knowledge-forge`, when the workflow calls for a GitHub Copilot review, request it directly after opening the PR by using GitHub CLI:

  `gh pr edit <PR_NUMBER> --add-reviewer @copilot`

- Required behavior:
  - Open the PR first, then request Copilot review.
  - Do not merge the PR after requesting Copilot review.
  - Leave the PR open for human review and for checks to turn green unless explicitly instructed to merge.
  - If the PR number is not already known, fetch it before requesting the review.
  - Treat this as the standard Knowledge Forge procedure for requesting a GitHub Copilot code review.
- Do not merge directly to `main` unless explicitly instructed.

## Build and Test
- Before changing code, inspect the repo and document the real install, lint,
  test, and validation commands that exist.
- Run `kf doctor` before non-trivial work when practical to capture local
  Python, git, required-doc, and environment readiness without printing secrets.
- Run `kf docs-check` for docs, workflow, publish-boundary, or handoff changes.
- Run `kf validate` before opening a PR when practical; it runs the local ruff,
  pytest, and whitespace checks and reports only commands that actually ran.
- If commands do not exist yet, report that clearly rather than inventing a fake
  workflow.
- For this repo's current bootstrap state, docs and scaffolding consistency are
  meaningful validation steps.

## Expected Delivery Pattern
For non-trivial work:
1. inspect the current repo state and branch/PR context
2. create a short implementation plan
3. implement on a new branch
4. review the result
5. run the relevant validation available in the repo
6. summarize risks, assumptions, and next actions

## Output Expectations
Final reports should include:
- task summary
- branch name
- files changed
- repo docs updates
- tests or validation run
- review findings
- separate FlowCommander repo-wiki update likely needed: `yes` or `no`
- remaining risks
- PR status or next action

For meaningful Knowledge Forge changes, the final report must state whether a
separate FlowCommander repo-wiki update is likely needed.
- Mark it `yes` only when the change affects the Knowledge Forge ->
  FlowCommander boundary, including:
  - publish contract changes
  - repo structure or artifact flow changes that affect FlowCommander handoff
  - wiki output structure changes under `repo-wiki/knowledge/`
  - review or approval workflow changes for published knowledge
  - provenance, contradiction, or supersession behavior changes
  - roadmap or execution changes that materially affect the integration boundary
- If `yes`, briefly state what should likely be updated in FlowCommander
  `repo-wiki` and why.
- If `no`, briefly state why no downstream durable knowledge changed.

For common task types, keep the finish line explicit:
- feature work: state the roadmap phase and artifact boundary respected
- bug work: state the root cause and what validation was real versus not yet available
- roadmap work: name the issue, acceptance signal, and any out-of-scope later-phase work left untouched
- docs work: say exactly which docs changed, or `none`
- cross-repo publish work: state what was staged in Knowledge Forge and what FlowCommander PR/publish step is next
